States
	UseStates
	UseReducer
	Context API
	 
useParams	
	The useParams hook returns an object of key/value pairs of the dynamic params from the current URL 
	that were matched by the <Route path>
	
useSearchParams 
	used to read and modify the query string in the URL for the current location
	
useNavigation 
	tells you everything you need to know about a page navigation to build pending navigation indicators 
	and optimistic UI on data mutations. 
Hooks
useState
	The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component. 
	State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application. 

useContext 
	React Context is a way to manage state globally.
	It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components more 
	easily than with useState alone.
	
useReducer
	The useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook.
	It allows for custom state logic. 
	If you find yourself keeping track of multiple pieces of state that rely on complex logic, useReducer may be useful.

useEffect
	The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
	Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
	
useRef

useCallback

useMemo

useTransition

useDeferredValue
